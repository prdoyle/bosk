	 * This produces predictable results even if done concurrently with
	 * other database updates.

	 * This requires the database state to be in good condition at the outset;
	 * it can't generally be used to repair corrupted databases
	 * unless the corruption is so mild that it doesn't
	 * interfere with proper functioning beforehand.
	 * It can be expected to evolve the database from that of a supported prior format,
