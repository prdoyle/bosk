# Bosk

![Three inquisitive cartoon trees with eyes](/art/bosk-3trees-wide-small.png)

Bosk is a Java library for state management in distributed systems.
It eases the journey from a simple standalone application to a high-availability clustered replica set
by supporting reactive, idempotent, deterministic control logic design patterns,
using an immutable in-memory state tree for ultra-fast reads (~50ns).

First, you start with just the `bosk-core` library, writing your application's control plane logic using Bosk.
The the built-in integrations with things like Jackson and Spring Boot help you get your application up and running.

Then, when the time comes to turn your standalone application into a high-availability replica set,
you can bring in the optional [MongoDB library](bosk-mongo).
The hard work of change propagation, ordering, durability, consistency, atomicity, and observability,
as well as fault tolerance, and emergency manual state inspection and modification,
is all delegated to MongoDB: a well-known, reliable, battle-hardened codebase.
You don't even need to trust Bosk to get all these details right:
all we do is send updates to MongoDB, and maintain the in-memory replica by following the MongoDB change stream.

If you'd rather use SQL instead of MongoDB, there's a [SQL library](bosk-sql) too.

## Getting Started

The [bosk-core](bosk-core) library is enough to create a `Bosk` object and start writing your application.

You can define your state tree's root node as a java Record, like this:

```
import works.bosk.StateTreeNode;
import works.bosk.Identifier;

public record ExampleState (
	// Add fields here as you need them
	String name
) implements StateTreeNode {}
```

Now declare your singleton `Bosk` class to house and manage your application state:

```
import works.bosk.Bosk;
import works.bosk.DriverFactory;
import works.bosk.Reference;
import annotations.works.bosk.ReferencePath;
import exceptions.works.bosk.InvalidTypeException;

@Singleton // You can use your framework's dependency injection for this
public class ExampleBosk extends Bosk<ExampleState> {
	public ExampleBosk() throws InvalidTypeException {
		super(
			"ExampleBosk",
			ExampleState.class,
			defaultRoot(),
			driverFactory());
	}

	public interface Refs {
		// Typically, you add a bunch of useful references here, like this one:
		@ReferencePath("/name") Reference<String> name();
	}

	public final Refs refs = rootReference().buildReferences(Refs.class);

	private static ExampleState defaultRoot() {
		return new ExampleState("world");
	}

	// Start off simple
	private static DriverFactory<ExampleState> driverFactory() {
		return Bosk.simpleDriver();
	}
}
```

You create an instance of `ExampleBosk` at initialization time,
typically using your application framework's dependency injection system.

To read state, acquire a `ReadContext`, providing access to a lightweight immutable snapshot of your state tree:

```
try (var __ = bosk.readContext()) {
	System.out.println("Hello, " + bosk.refs.name.value());
}
```

A read context is intended to be coarse-grained, for example covering an entire HTTP request,
giving you "snapshot-at-start" semantics and protecting you from race conditions.
It is an antipattern to use many small read contexts during the course of a single operation.

If you're using Spring Boot 3, you can bring in `bosk-spring-boot-3`
and set the `bosk.web.service-path` property to get an immediate HTTP REST API to view and edit your state tree.

To modify state programmatically, use the `BoskDriver` interface:

```
bosk.driver().submitReplacement(bosk.refs.name(), "everybody");
```

During your application's initialization, you can register a callback hook to perform an action whenever state changes:

```
bosk.registerHook("Name update", bosk.refs.name(), ref -> {
	System.out.println("Name is now: " + ref.value());
});
```

After this, you can add in other packages as you need them,
like [bosk-jackson](bosk-jackson) for JSON serialization.
or [bosk-mongo](bosk-mongo) for persistence and replication.
Use the same version number for all packages.

### Replication

When you're ready to turn your standalone app into a replica set,
add [bosk-mongo](bosk-mongo) as a dependency
and change your Bosk `driverFactory` method to substitute `MongoDriver` in place of `Bosk.simpleDriver()`:

```
import com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings;
import com.mongodb.ReadConcern;
import com.mongodb.WriteConcern;
import mongo.drivers.works.bosk.BsonPlugin;
import mongo.drivers.works.bosk.MongoDriver;
import mongo.drivers.works.bosk.MongoDriverSettings;

...
	private static DriverFactory<ExampleState> driverFactory() {
		MongoClientSettings clientSettings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
			.build();

		MongoDriverSettings driverSettings = MongoDriverSettings.builder()
			.database("exampleDB")
			.build();

		// For advanced usage, you'll want to inject this object,
		// but for getting started, we can just create one here.
		BsonPlugin bsonPlugin = new BsonPlugin();

		return MongoDriver.factory(
			clientSettings,
			driverSettings,
			bsonPlugin);
	}
```

To run this, you'll need a MongoDB replica set.
You can run a single-node replica set using the following `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM mongo:7.0
RUN echo "rs.initiate()" > /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/rs-initiate.js
CMD [ "mongod", "--replSet", "rsLonesome", "--port", "27017", "--bind_ip_all" ]
```

Now you can run multiple copies of your application, and they will share state.

## Development

### Code Structure

The repo is structured as a collection of subprojects because we publish several separate libraries.
[bosk-core](bosk-core) is the main functionality, and then other packages like [bosk-mongo](bosk-mongo) and [bosk-jackson](bosk-jackson)
provide integrations with other technologies.

The subprojects are listed in [settings.gradle](settings.gradle), and each has its own `README.md` describing what it is.

### Gradle setup

Each project has its own `build.gradle`.
Common settings across projects are in custom plugins under the [buildSrc directory](buildSrc/src/main/groovy).

### Versioning

In the long run, we'll use the usual semantic versioning.

For 0.x.y releases, all bets are off, and no backward compatibility is guaranteed.
