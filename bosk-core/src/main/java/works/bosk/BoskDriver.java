	 * could delegate to its downstream driver in the case that the database
	 * is empty, and could use the resulting initial state to initialize the
	 * database.

	 * @throws InvalidTypeException as a convenience to support initialization logic
	 * that creates {@link Reference References} (which is very common) so that implementations
	 * do not need to catch that exception and wrap it or otherwise deal with it:
	 * the caller of this method is expected to know how to deal with that exception.
	 * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this driver is unable to provide
	 * an initial state. Such a driver cannot be used on its own to initialize a Bosk,
	 * but it can be used downstream of a {@link ForwardingDriver} provided there is
	 * another downstream driver that can provide the initial state instead.

	 * <em>
	 * Note: Use of this method in application code is a smell.
	 * If you feel the need to call this in your application code, there's a pretty good chance
	 * you have logic that should be in a hook and isn't.
	 * It's intended to be called in system-level code and test cases, in order to provide
	 * the desired ordering guarantees.
	 * </em>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The definition of "prior" is intuitively the same as the "happens-before" relationship in
	 * the Java memory model, and includes:
	 *
	 * <ul><li>
	 *    any operation that "happens before" this call according to the Java memory model.
	 *    In particular,
	 * </li><li>
	 *    any operation that already happened on the same thread that called this method.
	 * </li><li>
	 *    any operation on any server that was successfully submitted to any bosk driver
	 *    configured to use the same backing database as this one.
	 * </li></ul>
	 *
	 * All of these events "happen before" this method returns.
	 * If a {@link ReadSession} is acquired after this method returns,
	 * all of the effects of the above operations (and possibly some additional subsequent operations)
	 * will be reflected in the bosk state.
	 * Hooks triggered by the above operations may or may not have run before this method returns.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * If you are familiar with the Java memory model, then all BoskDriver operations are
	 * "synchronizing operations" meaning that there exists a global ordering between all
	 * driver operations, even in different servers, as long as they are "the same bosk"
	 * (eg. backed by the same database).
	 * This method provides a kind of "no-op" synchronizing operation that allows you to reason
	 * about the order of events such as reads that would not otherwise have a well-defined order.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * This is expected to be an expensive operation, so callers should avoid calling this
	 * unless its strong semantics are required.
	 * For "stackable layer" drivers, this usually means they should not call this except
	 * to implement their own <code>flush</code> method.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Evolution note</strong>: This method currently acts as a full barrier, while
	 * ultimately we may want a more efficient release-acquire pair that allows writes
	 * to be reliably visible to subsequent reads.
