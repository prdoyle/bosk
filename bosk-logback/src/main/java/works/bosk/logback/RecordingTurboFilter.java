/**
 * Records log events that would otherwise be suppressed so they can be replayed on test failure.
 * <p>
 * To enable this feature, first add this filter to your {@code logback.xml}:
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;turboFilter class="works.bosk.logback.RecordingTurboFilter"/&gt;
 * </pre>
 * Then, annotate your test class or method with {@link ReplayLogsOnFailure @ReplayLogsOnFailure}.
 * <h2>Effect</h2>
 * This filter offers the illusion that you retroactively turned on debug logging for a failed test,
 * even if the logs were originally filtered out by logback's normal configuration.
 * <h3>Caveats</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *       The filter does <em>not</em> cause level queries like {@code isDebugEnabled} to return true.
 *       This means that if your code is written like this:
 *       <pre>
 *       if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
 *           logger.debug(...);
 *       }
 *       </pre>
 *       then this event won't be computed or logged, even if the filter is configured to capture debug events.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       The filter buffers the events in memory and does not format the messages until replay time.
 *       This means parameters passed to the logging methods will be stored for some time,
 *       so if the objects are mutated after the logging event,
 *       those changes <em>will</em> be reflected in the replayed logs,
 *       making them differ from what you would have seen if the events were logged normally.
 *       It can also add to the memory overhead if the objects are large.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       The filter only captures events that reach it in the filter chain.
 *       If you have some other filter that drops events before they reach this one,
 *       those events won't be captured and thus won't be replayed on failure.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       The filter captures the MDC at the time of logging,
 *       which is necessary to avoid getting the wrong values at replay time,
 *       but it adds overhead even for events that are ultimately discarded.
 *       This overhead is O(n) in the number of MDC entries.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Configuration properties:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *       {@code enabled} - Whether to record log events.
 *       Defaults to {@code false} so that only tests that explicitly
 *       opt in using {@link ReplayLogsOnFailure @ReplayLogsOnFailure}
 *       will have the overhead of buffering the logs.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       {@code level} - Finest-grained log level to record. Defaults to {@code DEBUG}
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       {@code capacity} - Max events to buffer per test, to put a limit on memory consumption.
 *       If there are more events, the oldest will be dropped. Defaults to 1000.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       {@code routingKey} - MDC key used to route events to correct test buffer; details below.
 *       Defaults to {@code bosk.junit.testId}
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       {@code filter} - Allows events to be omitted from the replay:
 *       if the nested filter returns {@code DENY}
 *       for an event, that event is not buffered for replay.
 * <p>
 *       Example:
 *       <pre>
 *         &lt;turboFilter class="works.bosk.logback.RecordingTurboFilter"&gt;
 *             &lt;enabled&gt;true&lt;/enabled&gt;
 *             &lt;filter class="works.bosk.logback.LoggerLevelFilter"&gt;
 *                 &lt;logger&gt;
 *                     &lt;name&gt;com.example.chatty&lt;/name&gt;
 *                     &lt;level&gt;INFO&lt;/level&gt;
 *                 &lt;/logger&gt;
 *             &lt;/filter&gt;
 *         &lt;/turboFilter&gt;
 *       </pre>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The default configuration is equivalent to:
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;turboFilter class="works.bosk.logback.RecordingTurboFilter"&gt;
 *       &lt;enabled&gt;false&lt;/enabled&gt;
 *       &lt;level&gt;DEBUG&lt;/level&gt;
 *       &lt;capacity&gt;1000&lt;/capacity&gt;
 *       &lt;routingKey&gt;bosk.junit.testId&lt;/routingKey&gt;
 *   &lt;/turboFilter&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@code enabled} and {@code capacity} properties can be overridden on a per-test basis using the {@link ReplayLogsOnFailure @ReplayLogsOnFailure} annotation's properties.
 * {@code routingKey} cannot be overridden because the routing key is the very thing that tells us which test is running (see below).
 * {@code level} also cannot be overridden per test because
 * it is crucial for performance that the filter quickly discards events that are too fine-grained.
 * <h2>Routing key</h2>
 *
 * The filter needs a way to associate log events with the correct test.
 * For simple single-threaded tests, the JUnit extension will set MDC key {@code bosk.junit.testId}
 * to the test's unique ID, and the filter can use that directly.
 * <p>
 * However, if the code you're testing is multithreaded, it's unlikely to propagate
 * the test ID to other threads, so the filter won't know which test the events belong to.
 * In this case, you can specify some other MDC key that your code <em>does</em> propagate across threads.
 * This is the <em>routing key</em>: the filter will attempt to associate the routing key with
 * the test ID whenever it sees them together in MDC.
 * Assuming the first log event for a test has both the test ID and routing key in MDC,
 * the filter will remember that association
 * and use it for subsequent events that only have the routing key.
 * <p>
 * Concretely, this works well for {@code bosk.instanceID},
 * which is an MDC key automatically propagated by bosk drivers.
