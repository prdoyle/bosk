	 * The general responsiveness of the system under unusual circumstances.
	 * Changes to the database connectivity and status will be "noticed"
	 * in about this many milliseconds, and other time-related behaviours
	 * are scaled accordingly.
	 * Lower values recover more quickly, but will also give up sooner
	 * and cause more network traffic;
	 * higher values are more patient and efficient, and can tolerate
	 * longer network disruptions, but are slower to recover.
	 * <p>
	 * Under normal circumstances, the system responds promptly
	 * and efficiently regardless of this setting.
	 * <p>
	 * For test cases,
	 *
	 * <ul>
	 *     <li>
	 *         If you are exercising timeout conditions, set this to a low value
	 *         (say, 10x the expected network round-trip delay)
	 *         to make your tests run quickly;
	 *     </li>
	 *     <li>
	 *         otherwise, you can set it to a high value (say, 5x its default)
	 *         to avoid spurious test failures,
	 *         though the default should also be fine.
	 *     </li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * In Bosk's own tests, we use even more extreme values to ensure
	 * this works across a wide range of values.
