/**
 * Decides which delivery mode the hook runner is in, and how many queued triggers
 * to allow before leaving overload mode.
 *
 * <p>
 * The hook runner reports the events that drive this state machine: queued and
 * dequeued triggers, completed triggers, and an empty backlog. This class turns
 * those events into mode transitions and probation budgets; it knows nothing
 * about the queue's contents or the hooks they run.
 *
 * <p>
 * Overload mode is left through a bounded standard-mode probation. The probation
 * starts when the compacted backlog has drained, and runs subsequent updates
 * one at a time. It succeeds if it spends its whole budget of triggers without
 * overflowing the queue. A successful probation enters {@link Mode#CATCH_UP}, a
 * transient mode that runs one final compacted generation before the driver
 * returns to standard mode.
 *
 * <p>
 * A standard-mode overflow soon after a successful probation means the probation
 * was too short. The next probation uses twice as many triggers as its budget.
 * After sustained standard-mode work, the multiplier decays linearly back to one.
