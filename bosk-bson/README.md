## bosk-bson

This is the subproject for the published `bosk-bson` library,
containing facilities for manipulating MongoDB's binary JSON data structures.
Outside of MongoDB itself, we also use BSON as a handy utility
for divide up and re-combine large JSON documents,
which is useful even outside of MongoDB.
